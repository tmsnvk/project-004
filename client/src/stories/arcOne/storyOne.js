    text: "You wake up in the common room at a table in a lousy tavern just before dawn. At first, you don't remember how you ended up here - you look around you (dirty clothes, a number of empty mugs) and it all comes back together. Another failed assignment - probably the last one this time - and you are on the streets yet again. Fascinating how low you can get in such a short time as a Knight once your Lord has gotten rid of you. You look around yourself and see several others passed on other tables or in front of the hearth, a non-caring and half-dosing keeper and two rather nasty looking fellows pestering two young lads on the other side of the hall.",
